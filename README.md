About Akash
From orchestrating complex, high-value projects to delivering tangible outcomes for clients across the globe, I am passionate about making a measurable impact in every role I take on. 
With 11 years of experience as an IT Project Manager, I’ve managed end-to-end project lifecycles, from budgeting to stakeholder alignment and agile delivery, focusing on maximizing efficiency, ensuring timely delivery, and exceeding client expectations. 
Currently, I’m enhancing my technical and analytical capabilities as a Master’s student in Data Science and Analytics at Maynooth University, Ireland, adding advanced data skills to my project management toolkit.
Throughout my career, I’ve maintained a strong track record of success by focusing on data-driven decision-making, agile methodologies, and effective communication. At Emvigo Technologies, I achieved significant milestones, including a 25% reduction in project interruptions through a robust risk management framework and an increase in repeat business by 25% through exceptional client service. My hands-on approach and dedication to continuous improvement have enabled me to drive project success while cultivating meaningful client relationships.
I am always open to discussing new opportunities where I can leverage my technical acumen, leadership abilities, and passion for analytics to drive project success. Let’s connect if you're looking for someone who brings both experience and innovation to the table to achieve shared goals.
